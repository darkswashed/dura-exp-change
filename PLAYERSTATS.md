# Player Stats Visualization

## Overview

The `playerstats.html` page provides an interactive visualization of individual player experience progression over time using data from the CSV snapshots.

## Features

- üîç **Player Search**: Enter any player name to view their stats
- üìä **Interactive Charts**: Visual line chart showing experience growth
- üìÖ **Historical Data**: Automatically loads data from all available snapshots
- üéØ **Case-Insensitive Search**: Find players regardless of capitalization
- ‚ö° **Client-Side Processing**: Works entirely in the browser, no backend required
- üåê **GitHub Pages Compatible**: Fully static and deployable on GitHub Pages

## How to Use

1. Open `playerstats.html` in a web browser
2. Enter a player's name in the text field (e.g., "King Swashed")
3. Click "View Stats" or press Enter
4. The chart will display the player's experience progression over time

## Technical Details

### Libraries Used

- **Chart.js**: For rendering the interactive line chart
- **PapaParse**: For parsing CSV files in the browser

### How It Works

1. **CSV Discovery**: The page scans for CSV files in the `snapshots/` directory by attempting to fetch files with the pattern `highscores_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` for the last 90 days
2. **Data Loading**: Each discovered CSV file is fetched and parsed using PapaParse
3. **Player Filtering**: The data is filtered to find all entries matching the searched player name (case-insensitive)
4. **Chart Creation**: The filtered data is sorted chronologically and displayed in a Chart.js line chart

### Data Structure

The CSV files are expected to have the following structure:
```csv
Name,Experience
PlayerName1,12345
PlayerName2,67890
```

### Error Handling

- **Empty Player Name**: Displays an error if no name is entered
- **Player Not Found**: Shows a message if the player doesn't exist in any snapshot
- **No Snapshots**: Alerts if no CSV files are found
- **Loading Indicators**: Visual feedback during data loading

## Examples

### Example 1: Viewing King Swashed's Stats

```
1. Enter "King Swashed" in the search box
2. Click "View Stats"
3. Chart displays experience progression across all available dates
```

### Example 2: Case-Insensitive Search

```
1. Enter "king swashed" (lowercase)
2. Click "View Stats"
3. Same results as using proper capitalization
```

## Deployment

This page is designed to work on static hosting platforms like GitHub Pages:

1. The page is already committed to the repository
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Access via: `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/playerstats.html`

## Limitations

- The page scans for CSV files from the last 90 days by default
- Each CSV file is loaded individually, which may take time if many snapshots exist
- Requires an internet connection to load Chart.js and PapaParse from CDN

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:

- Date range filtering
- Multiple player comparison
- Experience gain statistics (daily/weekly/monthly averages)
- Export data functionality
- Caching loaded CSV files to improve performance
